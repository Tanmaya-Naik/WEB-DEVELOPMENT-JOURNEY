# Web Development Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **end-to-end web development learning journey**, where I practice and revise core concepts by building small projects, experiments, and notes.

The goal of this repo is **skill-building, not perfection**. Code here reflects learning, iteration, and improvement over time.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository contains multiple folders representing:
- Concept-wise practice
- Small feature-based projects
- Revision code
- Notes and experiments

Some folders may contain:
- Separate frontend and backend setups
- Independent `package.json` files
- Practice components and demo implementations

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- `node_modules` and environment files are intentionally ignored using `.gitignore`
- This is a **learning repository**, so code quality and structure improve gradually
- Some folders may look repetitive as they represent revision attempts

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Build strong fundamentals in full-stack web development
- Practice real-world project structure
- Maintain consistency while learning
- Track long-term progress for self-review and interviews
